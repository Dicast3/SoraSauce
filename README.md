## Description
My personal list of sources for Sora/Sulfur

Here are sources made by me and other developers.
They were copied and pasted to archive them as study templates.
These external sources - ON THIS SPECIFIC REPO - do not work, they need to be modified to do so.
I included the link that goes back to the original author's page.
